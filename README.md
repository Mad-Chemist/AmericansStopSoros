# Who is George Soros

George Soros is the head of the [Open Society Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_society) which is a foundation with very strong DNC influences, as highlighted by the Podesta Wikileak [emails](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/14273), and their influence is encroaching on our country and has far too much [sway](https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15201) in the DNC

Thanks in-part to /pol/ and the_donald a movement has begun to rid his influence where it matters most. The electoral process.

OP quote:

> **I made a startling discovery last week. When it came out that the Voting Machines were compromised by Soros in 16 different states, I decided to call my Governor's office to see if my state could invoke their conflict of interest clause in their voting machine contract and fall back to a manual voting process/paper ballots.
When I informed them of this conflict of interest, they bounced me around a few times until someone at the Board of Elections said that I would have to contact each county's individual, local Board of Elections, as each county has its own fallback process in place.
Repeat this for 16 different states...**

> That's when I decided I needed some help.

> I'm compiling a list of every single county's Board of Elections in all 16 states affected by the Smartmatic/Soros machines so we can spam it to the entire internet and get everyone calling their local government, and get them to switch to paper ballots. **Soros is trying to steal the election. We're going to steal it back!**

> The 16 affected states are:
Arizona, California, Colorado, DC, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin.

tl;dr: George Soros is loosely involved with a company (Smartmatic) that supplies voting machines for the affected aforementioned 16 states. These states are almost all democratic or swing states.

# Smartmatic

They are the vechile of Soros' potentially weaponized voting machines. Smartmatic has been suspected in rigging elections in other countries which can be found in this 1.4(b) classified [leaked document](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06CARACAS2063_a.html) from Wikileaks.

#### Methodology

Swing state status was determined utilizing [politico](http://www.politico.com/2016-election/swing-states) polling data and [historical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state#Historical_swing_states) swing states.

Weighting: Swing states are given priority, then red states and then blue states. Subsets are ordered by electoral count.
