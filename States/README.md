# What Are These?

These are text files that follow the format xCounties.txt. They contain names, address and phone numbers for state's counties.

Every state document listed is a state that is infected with Soros connected voting machines. Visit the importance ranking to determine effective use of effort [here](https://github.com/HelloKitty/AmericansStopSoros/blob/master/README.md)

### Proposed Parsing Format

The data could be organized in many ways. I think a community effort should be made to decide on how. The only important part of the dataset right now is to determine if the county has been called yet. So, the simpliest way to indicate that in a parsable manner would be to append an X on the line of the county. If this becomes bigger we can reformat the data into a nicer more parsable format.
