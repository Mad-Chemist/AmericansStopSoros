Further investigation into the Commonwealth of Virginia leads to this page on the Virginia Department of Elections website which indicates that Smartmatic machines will NOT be used in this election.

This conflicts with Smartmatic's claims of having machines in use in Virginia. Perhaps some of the listed vendors are subsidiaries, or otherwise affiliated? Or it's possible that Smartmatic's claims are exaggerated and VA, at least, is clear from the conflict of interest under investigation.

#Update

Sequoia is a subsidiary of Smartmantic. Consider them one in the same.
