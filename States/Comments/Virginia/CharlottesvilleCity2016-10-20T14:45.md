State: Virginia County: (CITY) Charlottesville

No call was made, because the information is available on the City website: [http://www.charlottesville.org/departments-and-services/departments-h-z/voter-registration-and-elections/eslate-voting-system](http://www.charlottesville.org/departments-and-services/departments-h-z/voter-registration-and-elections/eslate-voting-system)

Charlottesville uses the Verity System by Hart InterCivic: [http://www.hartintercivic.com/content/verity-system-overview](http://www.hartintercivic.com/content/verity-system-overview)

I am unaware of documented conflict of interest with regards to Hart and this investigation.
