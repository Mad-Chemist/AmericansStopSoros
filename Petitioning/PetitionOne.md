Proposed petition verbage from [/u/mr_Braxx](https://www.reddit.com/user/mr_Braxx)

Hi! My name is _______ and I'm a citizen of _______ County. I'm calling today because it's recently come out in the news that Mark Malloch-Brown, the Vice Chairman of Smartmatic voting machines, is also the Vice Chairman of George Soros' Open Society Foundation - and the Open Society Foundation is one of Hillary's largest supporters. This is a huge conflict of interest, and jeopardizes the results of our election. We must not allow our election to be influenced by foreign actors and private companies. What we need to do immediately is exercise our Conflict of Interest Clause in our voting machine contract, and switch to the fallback voting process, and paper ballots. This alone will keep our election open, honest, and accurate.
